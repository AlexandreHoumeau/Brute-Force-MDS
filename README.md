# Brut-Force-MDS
This is a simple brut force application using puppeteer to automated the password cracking. It is using a password dictonary text file that has over 100 000 passwords.

## Launch the application
To use the brut force application you will first need to launch the front end application. For that:  
```cd client && npm run start``` 

## Launch the brut force
Now you can launch a new terminal for this commmands.  
```cd brut_force && npm run start```

The password for the client application is 'password'. Note that the brut_force algorithm is going through each line of the dictonary so it can take a while.
